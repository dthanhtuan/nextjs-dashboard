## App Router (new) vs Page Router (old)
### Differences Between Next.js Pages Router and App Router

Next.js offers two routing systems: the traditional **Pages Router** and the newer **App Router**. Each has distinct features, strengths, and ideal use cases.

## Overview

| Feature                        | Pages Router                               | App Router                                      |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Routing Structure**          | File-based routing with files in `/pages` folder. Each file corresponds to a route. | Nested folder-based routing inside `/app` directory with explicit route segments. |
| **Rendering Model**            | Client Components by default; no Server Components support. | Server Components by default; supports hybrid server/client rendering. |
| **Data Fetching**              | Uses special functions like `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps` for data fetching. | Uses async React Server Components and `fetch` directly inside components. |
| **Layouts**                   | Global or per-page layouts via `_app.js` and `_document.js`; layouts are static. | Supports nested, dynamic layouts with `layout.tsx` files per route segment. |
| **Dynamic Routing Syntax**     | Supported via file names with brackets (e.g., `[id].js`). | Supported with folder and file naming conventions, more explicit and flexible. |
| **Client-side Navigation**     | Uses `<Link>` component and `router.push` from `next/router`. | Uses enhanced `<Link>` and `useRouter` from `next/navigation`. |
| **Performance**                | Good for simple static or server-rendered pages; limited Server Component benefits. | Better performance with Server Components, streaming, and granular caching. |
| **Complexity & Learning Curve**| Simpler and easier for beginners.        | More complex; requires understanding of Server Components and new concepts. |
| **SEO**                       | Proven SEO performance with static generation and SSR. | Strong SEO support with server rendering and metadata API, but client components need care. |
| **Flexibility**                | Less flexible for complex nested UI and data fetching. | Highly flexible for complex apps with nested layouts and data dependencies. |
| **API Routes**                 | Built-in API routes inside `/pages/api`. | API routes are supported but structured differently (e.g., `route.js` files). |
| **Migration**                 | Stable and widely used; existing projects mostly use this. | Recommended for new projects; migration requires effort but offers modern features. |

## When to Use Which?

| Scenario                          | Recommended Router                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Simple, static sites or blogs     | Pages Router                          |
| Projects needing quick setup       | Pages Router                          |
| Complex apps with nested layouts  | App Router                           |
| Apps leveraging Server Components | App Router                           |
| Projects requiring advanced data fetching and caching | App Router               |
| SEO-critical projects              | Both viable; Pages Router proven, App Router improving |

## Summary

- **Pages Router** is the classic, simpler routing system based on files in the `/pages` folder. Itâ€™s ideal for straightforward apps and beginners.
- **App Router** is the modern, flexible system using nested folders in `/app`, supporting React Server Components, streaming, and advanced layouts. It suits complex, scalable applications.
- Next.js is moving toward the App Router as the future standard, but both routers are fully supported currently.
